## 1. [30 minutes] Introduction to Git and collaborative workflow lecture

## 2. [1 hour] Collaboration on Code of Conduct
- We will review the Code of Conduct together to make sure we all understand the values and goals of this course. You can make suggestions for guidelines by submitting pull requests to my repository. Each person will submit one pull request that I will merge.
### Steps:
0. Sync your fork with my repo: https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork 
	* `git fetch upstream` 
	* `git checkout master` 
	* `git merge upstream/master`
1. Make sure that the Code of Conduct file is open in your Sublime text editor
2. Make a change to the file. You can suggest new guidelines. When we are all satisfied, add your name to the document in your text editor. Then, commit your changes: `git add` `git commit`
*Make sure to put a good commit message!*
3. Fetch any changes from my repo: https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork
4. Then, push your changes to your remote origin: `git push origin master`
5. Finally, submit a Pull Request to my repository. Congratulations, you've submitted your first PR!
